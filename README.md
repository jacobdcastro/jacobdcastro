# Welcome to my Github ðŸ«¡

I'm [Jacob D. Castro](https://twitter.com/jacobdcastro), a full-stack software engineer specializing in Web3. Some tech I love to work with includes:

- Solidity
- TypeScript / JavaScript ES6+
- React
- Node.js (Express)
- GraphQL

I love Web3 a ton, but it's not yet ready for primetime; I love building things that help make Web3 more accessible.

## Fun Fact

I had the opportunity to save an NFT project, who discovered a bug in their ERC-721 smart contract **after** minting had already begun! For a full technical explanation of how I approached the problem, checkout out the [MetaMogulsNFT repo's README](https://github.com/jacobdcastro/MetaMogulsNFT/).
