## Welcome ðŸ«¡

I'm Jacob D. Castro, a full-stack software engineer specializing in Web3. Some tech I love to work with includes:

- Solidity
- TypeScript / JavaScript ES6+
- React
- Node.js (Express)
- GraphQL

I love Web3 a ton, but it's not yet ready for primetime; I love building things that help make Web3 more accessible.

## I am Open for Work!

I am **actively** seeking a full-time position in Web3. I am also open to part-time gigs via contract.

If you'd like to work together, please contact me via email (jacob@jdc.dev) or DM me on twitter!
